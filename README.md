# Concurrent Device Development

CDD is a repository containing lab work for my Concurrent Device Development (CDD) during my final year. The labs completed are solutions to a lot of concurrent programming problems seen within the Little Book of Semaphores by Allen B. Downey.

## Problems Solved
• Reusable Barrier using Semaphores <br>
• First in first out (FIFO) Queue using Semaphores <br>
• Producer / Consumer <br>
• Dining Philosophers <br>
